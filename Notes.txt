Creating a go module
    -> go mod init path (path is always unique -> ex: <github>/<username>/<project_name> || <website>/<project_name>)
    -> running the above command create a go.mod file which indicates it's a go module. 

Running a go file:
    -> go run filename
    -> go run module_path (ex: go run github.com/website/webserver)
